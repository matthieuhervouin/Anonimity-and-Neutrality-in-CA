# Anonimity-and-Neutrality-in-CA
An experiment with a brute force algorithm in order to know whether it is possible to have anonymous and neutral classification aggregation functions (CAF).

In order to run tests, use the file ANv2.py. In this file you can set up the number of categories rho, voters n and objects m. When it is done, run the file in order to know whether an anonymous and neutral CAF exists for this size of the problem. 
This problem grows exponentially in size with its parameters, and the algorithm used to solve it is very basic so the running time will grow very quickly.
